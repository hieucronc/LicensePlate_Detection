Objective: Develop a system to detect, crop, and read license plates from images using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Components:

Model Training:

YOLO (You Only Look Once): A state-of-the-art object detection model is used to identify license plates in images. The model is trained on a dataset of license plates to learn to recognize and localize them effectively.
License Plate Detection and Cropping:

Functionality: Detects license plates within images and crops the detected regions. This involves loading an image, using the YOLO model to find bounding boxes around license plates, and extracting these regions.
Text Extraction:

EasyOCR: An optical character recognition (OCR) tool that reads and extracts text from cropped license plate images. This step converts the visual data into readable text, which is then processed to obtain the license plate number.
Display and Processing:

Matplotlib: Used for displaying images in a readable format for validation and visualization purposes.
Workflow:

Load the image and apply YOLO to detect the license plate.
Crop the license plate region from the image.
Use EasyOCR to extract the text from the cropped license plate.
Display the cropped image and extracted text.
Outcome: An efficient pipeline for automatically detecting, cropping, and reading license plates from images, suitable for applications in vehicle registration, monitoring, and automated parking systems.
